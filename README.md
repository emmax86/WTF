# WTF
  Build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stevex86/WTF.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stevex86/WTF)
  
  Two simple scripts I devised for keeping track of terms and acronyms


# Use
## wtf - What's this for?
  wtf [term/acronym name]
  
  Output: The saved term or acronym definition
  
  Use: retrieving term
##tf - That's for
  tf
  
  Output: CLI process for storing term
  
  Use: storing term
  
  ---
  Note that although terms are piped into wtf as command line args, they may contain spaces in the names; wtf will automagically join each of the args into one term before searching.
