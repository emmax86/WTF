# WTF
Two simple scripts I devised for keeping track of terms and acronyms

# Use
## wtf - What's this for?
  wtf [term/acronym name]
  
  Output: The saved term or acronym definition
  
  Use: retrieving term
##tf - That's for
  tf [term/acronym name] [term/acronym definition]
  
  Output: none
  
  Use: storing term
  
  ---
  Note that terms are piped into the program as command line args; if you use spaces in your term name or definition, they must be respectively wrapped in quotes.
